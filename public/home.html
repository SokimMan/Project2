	Salesforce Contacts Page
</h1>

<p>
	Salesforce is software used by bussiness' to maintain a record of contacts, I currently use this software a lot in my job and created a tool modeling the features of contacts. Creating a new contact will add a new contact to the database, Search for a specific contact, or view all contacts.
